          <span class="text">The Nature Conservancy has  teamed up with the World Wildlife Fund to develop climate change adaptation  strategies for the Gulf of California and its coastal  watersheds.  Climate change ranks as a  high threat for three of our targets in the Gulf of California; coastal  shallows and soft bottoms, estuaries (mangrove and non-mangrove), and migratory  species, it ranks as a medium threat for insular species, rocky reefs and rocky  bottoms, seamounts and shoreline.&nbsp; <br />
            Based on the monthly mean  changes in temperature and precipitation from the ClimateWizard, our team hopes  to review key ecological characteristics that will be affected by climate  change to understand how seasonal changes could affect conservation  targets.&nbsp; Also from ClimateWizard we will use the historic monthly  averaged maps&nbsp;as a baseline to understand&nbsp;patterns of temperature and  precipitation that are critical&nbsp;for some targets.  Although we have found that the change is  relatively small, the timing and intensity&nbsp;is what may cause significant  impacts such as change in timing of monsoons or higher temperatures and less  precipitation during dry seasons.</span><br />

        <a name="gye" id="gye"></a>Great Yellowstone Ecosystem and Grizzly Bear denning affected by climate change:</strong><br />
        <span class="text">The Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, employed by the USGS at the Northern Rocky  Mountain Science  Center located in Bozeman, Montana has been studying the demography and ecology of grizzly bears  in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) since 1973. &nbsp; This population  was listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1975, and removed  from the list in 2007. &nbsp; A recent issue of Yellowstone Science &nbsp;was  dedicated to Yellowstone grizzlies and  chronicles the management and research that help conserve the species in the  Yellowstone Ecosystem (<a href="http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/ys16(2)partI.pdf">http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/ys16(2)partI.pdf</a>).  &nbsp;Past research by the study team (<a href="http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/files/norock/products/04HAROLD.PDF">http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/files/norock/products/04HAROLD.PDF</a>)  observed a trend towards later den entry during 1975-99 among adult male bears.  &nbsp;Denning events obtained during 2000-08 were added to the previous dataset  and strengthened the previously observed trend. &nbsp;Changes in phenology of  denning may be attributed to climate change. &nbsp;We intend to investigate  this potential using the climate trend data obtained from ClimateWizard.  &nbsp;Climate-influenced changes in phenology of den entry has implications for  managers tasked with minimizing conflicts between bears and humans,  particularly during fall ungulate hunting seasons. &nbsp; We will discuss the  potential impacts on both bears and people of a longer active season for  grizzly bears in the GYE.</span><br />

        <span class="text">The Lake Champlain  watershed is greatly endangered due to Climate Change.  We will use the past climate patterns for Vermont from the  CliamteWizard along with stream discharge and lake level datasets to predict  future impacts.  Additionally we hope to  use ClimateWizard output and our analyses to speculate about other important  effects of Climate Change on the watershed.   The goals of this project are to generate informed and coordinated  action to adapt to the impacts of climate change in Lake   Champlain and to educate people about the real and immediate  threat of climate change on this water shed.</span></p>

          <a name="atc" id="atc"></a>Climate Changes along the Appalachain Trail<br /></strong><span class="text">
          In November 2008, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (www.appalachiantrail.org) Board of Directors adopted a climate change resolution which committed to the Conservancy to a number of actions, including educating our members and Trail visitors on the impacts of climate change on the A.T. To do this we first needed a projection of the amount of climate change that the Trail could experience. Global climate models do not provide the necessary detail, particularly in mountain regions, such as those the A.T. passes through. With its ability to project climate change for areas as small as five miles square, Climate Wizard makes it possible for us to develop climate change projections relevant to the A.T. These projections show that the A.T. is likely to be drier than it has been historically, especially in the Southern Appalachians. During late summer 2007, drought conditions on the A.T. were so severe that the water sources hikers count on were all dry. Local hiking clubs were recommending against backpacking their sections of the Trail. Climate Wizard’s projections indicate that these severe conditions will become more common. Drier conditions are also likely to increase treadway erosion, especially when coupled with more intense precipitation events. The warming of the last 30 years has already resulted in a change in the composition of the forest along the A.T. Boreal tree species are disappearing in the Southern Appalachians and moving upslope further north. Climate Wizard’s projections show that this trend will continue and intensify. The birds and animals that depend on these specifies, e.g. Bicknell’s thrush, will also disappear, changing the experience of hiking the A.T.<br />
        To summarize, Climate Wizard has given us the ability to move from qualitative statements about the impact of climate change on the A.T. to quantitative projections of those impacts. It has helped define the threat to the Trail that we steward. </span></p>
