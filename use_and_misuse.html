                            The  ClimateWizard uses a linear regression-style trend analysis to calculate the  rate of climate change within every grid cell. This analysis produces maps of  both the rate of change, as well as the statistical confidence in this  change—more technically this is called statistical significance (<em>p</em>-value). Using the ClimateWizard, you can easily compare the map of change with the map of statistical confidence by  toggling between them using the buttons above the maps. When presenting these maps graphically, download both the map of change and the map of  statistical confidence and present them next to one another. Or when downloading  GIS data, make sure to get both the map of change and map of statistical  confidence, and use them together for running analyses and making decisions.

                            A  variety of gridded climate data sets have been created that range in spatial  resolution, geographic extent, time period, and climate variables [e.g. 1,5,6], and different  data sets may contain different estimates of climate for the same location [7].   The ClimateWizard currently contain two such historic datasets that each  have their own different caveats: the 1901-2002 CRU TS 2.1 global climate data  at ~50km (0.5 degree, <a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/~timm/grid/CRU_TS_2_1.html">http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/~timm/grid/CRU_TS_2_1.html</a>);  and the 1895-2006 PRISM climate data set for the contiguous United States  (Lower 48 states, ~4km resolution, <a href="http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/">http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/</a>).  Both of these datasets were initially developed for use in environmental models,  and have been adapted for use in climate change analysis. Note that for some  regions and time periods, climate-station data were insufficient for developing  accurate climate estimates, particularly early in the twentieth century, and  are represented as white grid cells having no data.

                            Since the spatial resolution of GCMs (2.5-3.5 degrees) is often too coarse for many scientific, management, and planning questions, a variety of methods have been developed for downscaling climate data to create finer spatial resolution data sets (Fowler et al. 2007).  However, increased spatial resolution, however, does not necessarily mean that data are more accurate. In some cases, the downscaling methods used to develop coarse-scale climate data are the same as those used to create fine-scale climate data, and these methods may ignore important processes that influence climate at regional and local scales (Daly 2006).  It is important to remember that future climate simulations are projections of future climate, not accurate predictions of future climate change for any particular location or specific moment in time.

                            The time period over which climate data are analyzed should be carefully selected to avoid drawing incorrect or biased conclusions [13].  The choice of the time period to analyze can influence the results of the analysis. For example, based on our analysis of the CRU TS 2.1 data, global mean temperature increased at 0.11 C/decade from 1941 to 2002, 0.16 C/decade from 1951 to 2002, 0.23 oC/decade from 1961 to 2002, and 0.33 oC/decade from 1971 to 2002 (See Girvetz et al. in review). Thus one’s conclusions about the pace of warming could vary threefold depending on the time interval sampled.

                            For example, two grid cells may have the same future projected percent decrease in precipitation but a 10% decrease in precipitation for a grid cell in northern Africa that has relatively little annual precipitation may represent a much smaller precipitation amount than a 10% decrease for a grid cell in the Brazilian Amazon region that receives a large amount of annual precipitation.  Likewise, a grid cell in the African Sahel region, for example, may have the same percent change in precipitation during January and August, but because it rains much more during August due to the monsoonal rains, the absolute precipitation change would be much greater during August. Thus, the ecological effect of the same simulated future percent decrease in precipitation may be very different depending on a number of factors, including the region’s total amount of annual precipitation, how the simulated precipitation decrease is distributed throughout the year, and the particular sensitivity to precipitation changes of the organism or system being studied. While we only presented percent change in precipitation, the ClimateWizard has the ability to calculate either percent or absolute change in precipitation.
